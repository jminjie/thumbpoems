# thumbpoems
Github-pages hosted [website](https://thumbpoems.com) for poems penned on phones.

The `static` directory holds static assets (images and css).

The `poems` directory holds the actual poem image files.

The `transcriptions` directory holds my manual transcriptions of the poems.

This can be edited from mobile using FastHub Pro. Files can be renamed with Root Browser, and can be uploaded using Github's desktop webpage.

{"transcription": "A note: It's hard to fathom time away from you / Like death doesn't compute, absence makes the heart nothing / But presently I crave more than eternity / Another night in your arms / Sidewinding the topography of your bosom / A rattlesnake ignoring my own battle cry / As I race toward the chasm of lessons I thought I'd learned / Too ready to dive headfirst / Into fire and ice alike / an overpaid sherpa / Shuttling frigid instagrams to the top"}
